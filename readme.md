# Fortnite Math
Inspired by the scratch version of this game, fully ported to python. Will there be a multiplayer version of this game? Maybe, I'm working on the server.py recently. If you want to contribute to this project, please do! Hoping for a fully stable version of the game, free of visual and asset problems.
