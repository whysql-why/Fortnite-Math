# Fortnite Math
Inspired by the scratch version of this game, fully ported to python. Will there be a multiplayer version of this game? Maybe, I'm working on the server.py recently. If you want to contribute to this project, please do! Hoping for a fully stable version of the game, free of visual and asset problems.


# CONTRIBUTE PLEASE!!! NEED HELP!!! 
Help me break down the all the if/else statements and help me make the project more professional! Please pull, thanks!


multiplayer to do:
1. The whole packet system for multiplayer
2. Validation each packet sent from client for spoofed packets or invalid packets
3. No checks for username ownership(for multiplayer), too advanced for this project, but If i want it going that way, I will probably add auth to each username and through an API to check username and password from the backend database.
