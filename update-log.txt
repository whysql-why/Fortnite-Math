update log for this project.

to do:
- fix gun image offsets, positions are not right for some guns.(two ways to do this)
- fix that one guy that keeps rendering up instead of down(guy_healing)

username issue will never be fixed.

2024-12-25:
- fixed a small bug where the game would get random enimies before a new question was asked. [it happened because weapon_has and global_weapon was not reseting each time]
- finally game is now looping like we wanted it to.
- fixed issue where weapon was not tracked or being rendered when a new enemy was spawned in.
- added map 
- added clouds, it's so good now with clouds.
- fixed issue where map was not being rendered when the gun "animation" was happening.
- tried fixing the username issue, still not working.
- added victory royale image and the animation at the end.
- added player counter below the map. ( added the image as well with it )
- added some more messages to the messages.yml.
